In the next 6 months three new projects will start (and excitingly 3 post-doc positions will be available), two of which were funded by <a href="https://www.ukri.org/councils/nerc/">NERC</a> and the third by <a href="https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe_en">Horizon Europe</a>.</p>

<p>The projects are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>PARTITRICS led by Prof. Stephanie Henson at the National Oceanography Center, as part of the <a href="https://noc.ac.uk/projects/bio-carbon">BIO-Carbon</a> program. This project will investigate controls on the remineralisation of sinking carbon in the North Atlantic Ocean.</li>
  <li>Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW) project led by Dr Athanasios Paschalis in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Imperial, in collaboration with Dr Bonnie Waring (Imperial) and Dr Kieran Khamis (University of Birmingham). Across the team we will look at the fate and ecological impact of in fields and rivers prior to carbon storage in the oceans.</li>
  <li>Sea-Quester led by Prof. Marja Koski at the Danish Technological University, Denmark. This is a large consortia grant across many different international institutes. The aim of the project is to identify new and emerging hotspots of blue carbon in Polar and Europrean seas.</li>

<p>I spoke on the panel along with Prof Hans-Otto Poertner and Bec Hubbard to discuss what we know about the role of fish and marine ecosystems in storing carbon, and how fisheries might be disrupting the carbon cycle. This is part of on-going research to investigate more about how we can protect fish stocks from over-fishing as well as the carbon cycle and the health of our planet.</p>

A key part of the report was to estimate the value of krill in ‘blue carbon’, storing carbon in the ocean away from the atmosphere.</p>

<p>I worked with my colleague Dr Neill Mackay at the University of Exeter, to calculate the deep ocean krill faecal pellet carbon sink and worked out how long krill pellet carbon might remain in the deep by analysing ocean circulation patterns. Our analysis focused on the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean where krill populations are high, finding that krill here contribute billions of dollars worth in carbon sequestration value. The report was presented to delegates at the <a href="https://www.ccamlr.org/en/organisation/home-page">Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources</a> annual meeting this year (October 2022) to help provide scientific support for protecting important krill habitats.</p>

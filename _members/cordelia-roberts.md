Cordelia is a Post-Doctoral Research Associate in Marine Biogeochemistry at Imperial College London based in the Department of Life Sciences at [Silwood Park](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/silwood-park/). She completed her PhD in marine microbial ecology and oceanography on the diversity and activity of microbial communities associated with organic material in the marine environment in 2023 from the [Marine Biological Association (MBA), Plymouth](https://www.mba.ac.uk/). She stayed for her first post-doc at the MBA working on characterising the variability in organic material found in Plymouth Sound and the Western English Channel off the coast of Plymouth, and their associated fungal communities. 
Cordelia joins Emma’s group as part of the [NERC funded BIO-Carbon project PARTITRICS](https://bio-carbon.ac.uk/). She will be looking at how different particle types (sinking particles and faecal pellets) play a role in the rate of microbial respiration in the North Atlantic. Marine microbes convert organic carbon in particles to carbon dioxide (CO2) during respiration where it is either stored (sequestered) or lost to the atmosphere, meaning they play an important role in setting atmospheric concentrations of CO2.  Cordelia will be taking part in a research cruise for 6 weeks to the North Atlantic to conduct fieldwork and experiments to understand how different particle types control microbial respiration in the surface ocean and down to 1000 m, in a depth region of the ocean called the ‘Twilight Zone’. She is also the co-Lead for the [BIO-Carbon Early Career Ocean Professional’s Network](https://bio-carbon.ac.uk/early-career).

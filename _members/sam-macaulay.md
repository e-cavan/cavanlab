Sam is a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial College London. He completed his PhD at University of Otago, New Zealand, in 2020, investigating the combined effects of climate change and insecticide pollution on streams and rivers. In 2021, he became a Science Advisor to the New Zealand Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment before moving to a postdoctoral research position at The University of Oxford and Trinity College Dublin (based in Oxford) in 2022. There, he continued exploring the interactive effects of climate change and chemical pollution in aquatic ecosystems, using mesocosm experiments to understand how multiple stressors interact to affect ecosystem diversity and functioning.

Samâ€™s research spans ecology, ecotoxicology and biogeochemistry. Currently, he is studying the implications of enhanced rock weathering as a negative emissions technology for freshwater ecosystems.

Emma attended her first [British Ecological Society policy](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/policy/]) committee meeting today. She will be part of the committee for 3 years representing Early Career Researchers. The committee meets quarterly to discuss and approve various projects the BES is endorsing to promote ecological science to the wider public and policy makers.

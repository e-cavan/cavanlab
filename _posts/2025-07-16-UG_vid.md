Carbon, particles, and members of the Cavan lab were filmed as part of a [1-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rco9TVY4pAA) to showcase Imperial's students to prospective undergraduate students! Using phytoplankton cultures we make sinking aggregates in the lab, and then measure how quickly microbes degrade the carbon - effectively simulating what happens in the open-ocean. Keep watching until the end!

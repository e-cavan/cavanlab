# Carbon  -  Nature  -  Water  -  Detritus


We are a team of researchers inspired by nature and driven by our desire to understand more about the natural world whilst protecting it. Based at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), we combine biogeochemistry and ecology to discover what drives natural carbon sinks, and how climate change and human use might alter important natural cycles.
